By eliminating all of the unnecessary elements found in typical solutions, we can focus on pure design, usability and clean code. You shouldn't have to spend hours installing a platform, customizing a theme or template and then adding content in order to achieve what you are looking to do with your website. We have created a human-usable solution for minimalist websites called \"Leeflets\" that can be used \"out-of-box\" for specific purposes without any of the headache.<br><\/p>"
