Leeflets
========

In a flooded marketplace of overly complex website templates, content management systems and frameworks, Leeflets has been created and is devoted to delivering a much needed alternative for minimalist single page websites. We're just getting started, so if you have any questions, comments, bugs to report or enhancements that should be implemented, please do feel free to post those here on GitHub.
